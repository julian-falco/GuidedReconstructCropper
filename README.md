# ReconstructCropper

This program is intended for use with the RECONSTRUCT software developed by the Harris Lab.

When selecting your series, select the FOLDER that contains the series file.

Given a specific object within a series of section images, the program will create a new set of files with the images cropped around the object.
This program can also create a grid-style crop of a set of pictures.
The intention for this program is to cut time on loading images in the RECONSTRUCT software and prevent crashing, as the cropped images take less spce in memory.

To use the .py files, you will need to have Python installed on your computer.
The executable file can be used without Python.
