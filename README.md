# GuidedReconstructCropper

This program is intended for use with the RECONSTRUCT software developed by the Harris Lab.

Given a specific object within a series of section images, the program will create a new set of files with the images cropped around the object.
The intention for this program is to cut time on loading images in the RECONSTRUCT software; the cropped section images will take less time to load.

To use this program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer.
Ensure that the Pillow and opencv-python modules are installed on your computer.
To do this open the command prompt on your computer (type CMD in the search bar) and type in the following:

pip install Pillow

pip install opencv-python

At this point, you should be able to download and run the python file.
