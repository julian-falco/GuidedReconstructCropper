# GuidedReconstructCropper

This program is intended for use with the RECONSTRUCT software developed by the Harris Lab.

Given a specific object within a series of section images, the program will create a new set of files with the images cropped around the object.
The intention for this program is to cut time on loading images in the RECONSTRUCT software; the cropped section images will take less time to load.

New traces made on these files can be merged back to the original set of files.
The program also has a built-in function to restore the set of files to the original settings with the new traces.
