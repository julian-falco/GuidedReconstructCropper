# ReconstructCropper

This program is intended for use with the RECONSTRUCT software developed by the Harris Lab.

Given a specific object within a series of section images, the program will create a new set of files with the images cropped around the object.
This program can also create a grid-style crop of a set of pictures from scratch.
The intention for this program is to cut time on loading images in the RECONSTRUCT software; the cropped section images will take less time to load.

To use the program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer.
The executable file can be used without Python.
